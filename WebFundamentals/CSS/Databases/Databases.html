      <h3>What are Databases?</h3>
      <h6>A structured set of data</h6>
      <p>Databases are a collection of information, they are used for creating,
        manipulating, and deleting data. There are many different types of databases
        and they can be classified in a basic approach of relational database or a
        non-relational database. Relationships means a set of our data is related to
        another section of our data. Meanwhile in a non-relational database there
        is not a common related section of our data. Our databases are put into
        sections of data called schemas, inside each schema each data set is organized
        into tables, those tables contain columns and rows to house that particular
        set of data.</p>

        <h3>Storage</h3>

        <p>All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is housed on your
          harddrive, often times large companies will have floors upon floors of just
          database storage (think NSA styled). Our computer stores information on
          the harddrive, we are able to create new information, read information,
          update information and delete information.</p>
