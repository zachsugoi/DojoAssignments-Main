        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
        JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small
        and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to
        take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a
        host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to
        the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
        them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are
            containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with
            coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All
            JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These
            unique names are called identifiers. <span class="example_code">var
            x;</span></li>
          <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign
            values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured
            in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment
            operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="example_code">
            var x = 10;</span></li>
          <li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to
            be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There
            are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class ="example_code">
            true</span> or <span class="example_code">false;</span> null - <span class ="example_code">
            null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class ="example_code">42</span>
            or <span class ="example_code">3.14159;</span> String - <span class ="example_code">
            "Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class ="example_code">
            [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class ="example_code">
            {first_name: 'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span></li>
          <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to
            perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different
            code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can
            use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are
            the following conditional statements: <span class ="example_code">
            if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;
            <span class ="example_code">else if</span> to specify a new condition
            to test, if the first condition is false; <span class ="example_code">
            else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
          <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every
            programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they
            will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run
            a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
            That's a loop!</li>
          <li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code
            block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think
            of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting
            together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get
            started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the
            table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there
            are a ton more tables to do so let's call our function over and over
            and over again.</li>
